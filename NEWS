  instead of the try catch steps we used before.
- New and more efficient couchbeam_view API. we now parse json stream
  instead of getting all results. New couchbeam_view:stream and
couchbeam_view fetch functions have been added. We also don't use any
more a view record in other functions
- HTTP functions have been moved to couchbeam_httpc modules
- gen_changes behaviour has been updated to use the couchbeam_changes
  API. It's also abble to restart a lost connection for longpoll and
continuous feeds.

  functions using the #view{} record from these functions have been
moved in couchbeam_oldview module.
- couchbeam:wait_changes, couchbeam:wait_changes_once, couchbeam:changes
  functions have been deprecated and are now replaced by
couchbeam_changes:stream and couchbeam_changes:fetch functions.
